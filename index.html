                        companies that are created as a result of the Africaneur IQ (AIQ) RESET Model of Economic
                        Transformation.
                        <br><br>
                        RESET stands for Rapid Equitable Sustainable Economic Transformation and is a proprietary model
                        used by AIQ to facilitate economic transformation in South Africa under the Broad Based Black

                    The Beneficiary Companies in the RESET Model undergo rapid expansion and growth, typically
                    underpinned by three to five year offtake contracts and concessionary funding with the sole
                    objective of increasing market share and taking a significant position in its particular sector. RC
                    will provide a dedicated mechanism for Beneficiary entrepreneur to cross the Transitional
                    Transformation Capital gap initially and thereafter to allow for the natural exit of the Capacity
                    Accelerators if required. RC also intends to provide ad hoc financial support to Beneficiary
                    companies as and when required.

                    Reset Capital (RC) is an investment firm with a unique focus on investment opportunities in BEE
                    companies that are created as a result of the Africaneur IQ (AIQ) RESET Model of Economic
                    Transformation.

                    The Beneficiary Companies in the RESET Model undergo rapid expansion and growth, typically
                    underpinned by three to five-year offtake contracts and concessionary funding with the sole
                    objective of increasing market share and taking a significant position in its particular sector.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to rapidly expand the capacity of the designated beneficiary’s start-up, AIQ’s model
                    harnesses the introduction of an early stage equity investor (usually between 40%-49%) to accelerate
                    the capacity expansion.
                    <br><br>
                    This methodology creates a unique initial capital requirement that arises between the time that the
                    beneficiary entrepreneur creates the new start-up and when free cash-flows are generated from the
                    blue-chip off take agreements having leveraged the capacity acceleration. This type of investment is
                    referred to as Transitional Transformation Capital (TTC) is represents the first round of funding RC
                    is focussed on.
                    <br><br>
                    The second round of investment (usually within 12-24 months from the first TTC) follows when the
                    traditionally white shareholder/s of the capacity accelerator selects a natural exit. At that point
                    RESET Capital is able to accommodate the capacity accelerator and aims to assist the beneficiary for
                    a potential listing within a further 24-36-months.

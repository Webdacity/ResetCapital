                    objective of increasing market share and taking a significant position in its particular sector.
                    In order to rapidly expand the capacity of the designated beneficiary’s start-up, AIQ’s model
                    harnesses the introduction of an early stage equity investor (usually between 40%-49%) to accelerate
                    the capacity expansion. This traditionally white shareholder/s has a natural 24-36-month exit
                    horizon. At that point RESET Capital enables the exit of the capacity accelerator and aims to assist
                    the beneficiary for a potential listing within a further 24-36-months.
